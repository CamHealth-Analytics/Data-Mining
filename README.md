<!-- Maternal Mortality Prediction Project -->

Overview
This project aims to leverage data analytics and classification techniques to predict maternal mortality risks in Cameroon. It involves building a data warehouse, creating an ETL pipeline, performing OLAP queries, and implementing machine learning models like Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

Key Components
ETL Process
Extract, Transform, and Load healthcare data into the data warehouse.

<!-- Data Warehouse -->
Store cleaned and preprocessed healthcare data for analysis.
